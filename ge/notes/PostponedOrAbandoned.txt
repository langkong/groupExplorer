## Group Explorer load performance thoughts (measure/compare?)
 * Establish performance target
 * Load group files
     * Concatenate group files (download entire library at once)
     * Load group files in web workers, pass XMLGroup(s) back to main thread
 * Pre-calculate thumbnail png's as files
     * Just Cayley diagrams?
     * Concatenate png files and shred them on client?
     * Download to web workers, pass back as data to main thread?
 * Initially display MathML as HTML, then replace with MathJax output as it's rendered


literate programming: nothing widely accepted for javascript (!?)
  litpro -- extract code from .md file (into build directory)
  maked -- converts .md into .html
  vmd -- displays .md exactly as github would



Abandoned:

use web workers to improve performance:
  web workers can't modify DOM
  can't make .png without DOM <canvas> for context (and you need document to create <canvas>)
  most of our time is spent rendering, there's not much work we can offload
