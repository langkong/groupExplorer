# Help system source files

This folder contains all the files that `mkdocs` uses to generate
the HTML-based help pages included in the *Group Explorer*
website.

To generate the files, ensure that you havel
[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) installed on your system
(I'm using version 1.0.4 as of this writing) and run it from
within the root of this repository.  Doing so will build all the
source files from this folder (following the plan in the
`mkdocs.yml` file in the repository root) into the `help` folder
(a sibling of this folder).
