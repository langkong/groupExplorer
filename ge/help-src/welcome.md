# New to *Group Explorer?*

Group Explorer is a piece of software for visualizing the mathematical
objects known as groups. Here are some places you might want to get started:

## What to read first

 * [The Getting Started page](gs-index.md),
   with links to tutorials
 * [Group theory terminology](rf-groupterms.md),
   if you're new to group theory
 * [Group Explorer terminology](rf-geterms.md),
   specific to this software

## Beginners' tips

The group library is [the main window of *Group
Explorer*](rf-um-mainwindow.md) and shows all loaded groups. Try
clicking [tapping] them to learn more about them.
(Touch gestures are listed in [brackets] after the mouse action.)

If you need help, each page of the application has help links in the top
right corner that go to the specific portion of the help files relevant to
that page. This window is a typical help window. Search help from the menu
or toolbar above.

*Group Explorer* is all about visualization.  To see some of the images,
click a group from [the library
page](http://nathancarter.github.io/group-explorer/GroupExplorer.html) and
then click one of the pictures you see.  Or try one of these links:

 * [Example group info file](http://nathancarter.github.io/group-explorer/GroupInfo.html?groupURL=groups/D_4 x Z_2.group)
 * [Example visualization](http://nathancarter.github.io/group-explorer/SymmetryObject.html?groupURL=groups/A_4.group)

# New to version 3.0?

New features in this version:

 * The application is now on the web!
    * This is the first update in about ten years - wow!
    * You do not need to install anything to start using *Group Explorer* right away.
    * To share with anyone else an image or other information in the software,
      just copy the URL from the top of your browser and share it however you like
      (email, blog, text message, etc.).
    * The user interface and help files have all seen significant updates as part
      of the process of converting the application to the web.
      In particular, this is the first update of the software since
      [Visual Group Theory](http://web.bentley.edu/empl/c/ncarter/vgt/) was published,
      and thus the help now contains references to material in the text (and on
      related websites) that supplement what you can get from the software.
    * Thanks to the newest developer on the *Group Explorer* team,
      Ray Ellis, who pioneered most of the work of converting the app to the web.
 * There are sure to be bugs in version 3.0, because it is so new.
   Please feel free to report them using
   [the project's issue tracker](https://github.com/nathancarter/group-explorer/issues).
 * Many updates are planned for versions 3.1, 3.2, and so on, so check back
   later for more.
