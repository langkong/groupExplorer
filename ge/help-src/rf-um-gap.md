# *GAP* (Groups, Algorithms, Programming)

[*GAP*](http://www.gap-system.org) is a large and powerful programming
language for computations in abstract algebra and discrete mathematics.  It
has been around since the 1980s, and continues to have regular releases
today.

Throughout the *Group Explorer* app, you will find buttons labeled "Compute
this in GAP." Clicking such a button will reveal a box containing *GAP* code
that does the computation or visualization you're looking at.  This can be
useful for several purposes.

 1. If you want to move beyond *Group Explorer* to something more powerful,
    *GAP* is an excellent next step.  These small samples of *GAP* code
    can serve as tiny tutorials, showing you how to do short comptuations
    in *GAP.*
 1. If you aren't sure what *Group Explorer* is reporting, and want to see
    its results more specifically, the *GAP* output is sometimes a good
    place to start.  It may contain more technical details than *Group
    Explorer* reports.
 1. If you want to take the results of a computation that *Group Explorer*
    has done and manipulate them further, you can do so right on the web,
    by revealing the *GAP* code, editing it to extend it as needed, and
    then clicking "Run" to see the results.
 1. If you think there is a mistake in *Group Explorer* and want to report
    a bug to us, start by checking whether *Group Explorer* agrees with
    *GAP.*  If it doesn't, definitely
    [send us a bug report!](https://github.com/nathancarter/group-explorer/issues)

The technology we use to include runnable *GAP* code in *Group Explorer* is
the [*Sage* Cell Server](https://sagecell.sagemath.org).
[*Sage*](http://www.sagemath.org) is a large piece of software for
computational mathematics that tries to include as many mathematical tools
as it can, including *GAP.*  The cell server makes all of Sage (including
*GAP*) available for live use on the web.

To go further with *Sage* or *GAP*, consider these options:

 * [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/app),
   a cloud service providing access to *Sage* (including *GAP*)
